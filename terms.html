However, we cannot guarantee any accommodation outside of the period of your internship program, and the cost of any such accommodation is entirely your responsibility.<br> (c) to provide you with a transfer, at a time agreed between us, from the closest international airport to your accommodation on your arrival, prior to your commencement on the Program <br>(d) to provide contact details of local staff in case of any difficulties or problems experienced and to facilitate emergency support if necessary;<br> (e) to provide an induction and welcome talk upon your arrival. <br>(f) to provide you with visa assistance where necessary. <br>(g) to provide you with information and tools to enhance your professional development. <br>(h) to organize social events, for you and the other participants, at your destination. For the avoidance of doubt, we will only be responsible for and are only bound to provide the services and matters set out in Section 1 above. <br><br>2. SUITABILITY OF PARTICIPANTS We retain all rights to reject the application of any person we deem unsuitable for our Program, at our own discretion.<br><br> 3. DEPOSIT AND PROGRAM FEE <br>(a) Your Initial Deposit (“Initial Deposit”) is $600 United States Dollar (abbreviated as USD or $) regardless of destination. <br>(b) Upon payment of your Initial Deposit, you agree to fully cooperate with  Enveiria, Inc. in its attempts to find you a placement and agree to do so until the passing of the Placement Deadline. Examples of non-cooperation include, but are not limited to: Not actively working with your assigned representatives from Enveiria, Inc.; Skipping or missing scheduled internship interviews; Not engaging in internship discussions with your Internship Coordinator; Not responding to Enveiria, Inc. communications in a timely manner; Allowing the placement process to be delayed due to missing agreed payment due dates Unreasonably refusing internships offered to you. Dishonesty. This includes fabricating, altering, or misrepresenting academic transcripts, test scores, academic standing, statements made on visa applications, or any other written or oral statement you may make in the process of applying for the Program, for a visa, or for any internship role. Participants who are deemed uncooperative will be notified by Enveiria, Inc. and may be dropped from the program with no refund given. Such Participants may have the option, at the discretion of Enveiria, Inc. to rejoin the Program, provided that they cooperate and participate in good faith.<br> (c) If Enveiria, Inc. is unable to place you in an internship role in your Preference Area before the Placement Deadline, you will be given the option (1) to withdraw from the Program and receive a refund of your Initial Deposit and all other Program payments made by you (“Full Refund”), or (2) to request that Enveiria, Inc. continue the search process until you are placed; and if Enveiria, Inc. is still unable to place you within the extended time, you will receive a Full Refund. <br>(d) If your Initial Deposit is received by us less than eight weeks before the Commencement Date, your Placement Deadline will be one week prior to the Commencement Date. This is instead of the usual three weeks. <br>(e) In order to confirm your place in the program, you must pay at least 50% of your outstanding balance within 30 days after we have received your Deposit. Any remainder is due within 21 days after we have confirmed your internship role. Notwithstanding any partial payment deadline previously given, once placement is confirmed, any & all remaining balance becomes due within 21 days. In all cases, all program fees must be paid before you travel to your program destination. Participants who fail to meet this requirement, will receive none of the benefits of the Program. This includes, without limitation; placement in a confirmed Program, airport transfers and accommodation. <br>(f) If your Initial Deposit is received by us less than eight weeks before the Commencement Date, your deadline to proceed with payment of the remaining balance will be one week prior to your start date.<br> (g) Due to the scarcity of housing in Hong Kong, some participants in our Hong Kong program are subject to earlier payment deadlines than those described in the paragraph above. If this applies to you, then we will notify you of your revised payment deadlines in writing via email, and the payment terms specified in that email will supersede those described in this document. <br>(h) Due to the scarcity of shared accommodation housing in New York, some participants in our New York program may be subject to supplemental costs associated with having a private room. Participants pursuing longer durations within the shared accommodation options should be further advised that this likely means you will have multiple roommates throughout the duration of your stay. If this applies to you, then we will notify you of your revised payment structure in writing via email with at least 30 days advance notice of your start date. The payment terms specified in that email will supersede those described in this document. <br>(i) You are responsible for covering all and any charges imposed by financial institutions, including PayPal fees, foreign transaction fees, and wire transfer fees. This applies to your Deposit, Program Fee and any other transfer to us. If you underpay your Deposit due to such charges, you will make up the balance when you pay the Program Fee. If you underpay by less than 75 USD (or equivalent), we will collect it from you at the program destination after you have arrived. If you underpay by more than 75 USD (or equivalent), you must make another payment before arrival. If you overpay by more than 50 USD (or equivalent), we will refund the overpayment amount to you according to our normal procedures. If you overpay by less than 50 USD (or equivalent), no refund will be given due to the administrative costs involved.<br> (j) Some participants may be eligible for a discounted program fee – for example, students enrolled in a university with whom Enveiria, Inc. has a formal relationship. If a participant is eligible for more than one discount, then Enveiria, Inc. has the sole power and discretion to decide how or whether the discounts may be combined, or if only one discount may be applied. <br><br>4. REQUEST TO CANCEL, VARY PARTICIPATION ON THE PROGRAM AND REFUNDS <br>(a) If you wish to withdraw from the program at any time, then this must be done via a written request. For the avoidance of doubt, such a written request can be made by email. <br>(b) The Deposit, and all subsequent Program Fees paid, are not refundable if you withdraw from the Program for any reason other than Enveiria, Inc.’s failure to place you by the Placement Deadline in your Preference Area. This includes withdrawal for medical, personal, family, academic, financial, and all other reasons. The Deposit, and all subsequent Program Fees paid, are refundable ONLY if Enveiria, Inc. fails to place you in an internship role, in your Preference Area, by the Placement Deadline, as defined in this document. <br>(c) The Deposit, and all subsequent Program Fees paid, are not refundable if Enveiria, Inc. determines, in its sole discretion, that you did not fully co-operate in the placement process at any time before the Placement Deadline, as further detailed under section 3(b) above.<br> (d) If you withdraw from the Program for any reason after being placed in an internship role, Enveiria, Inc. will be entitled to 100% of your Initial Deposit and either 100% of the subsequent payment(s) you made after the Deposit or 50% of the Program Fee, whichever is greater. If the withdrawal takes place less than 21 days before the Commencement Date, Enveiria, Inc. will be entitled to 100% of your Initial Deposit and 100% of the Program Fee.<br> (e) If you want to change the start or end date of your participation in the Program after being placed with a partner organization, a change fee of US$250 may be charged. If such a request is made within 21 days of the Commencement Date or after an invitation letter has been issued, we reserve the right to refuse the change request or to apply an additional charge which shall be determined at our sole discretion. <br>(f) In the event that, for any reason at all, you decide to discontinue your place on the Program after it has started but before it is due to end, no refund will be given.<br> (g) If, for whatever reason, we have to cancel your participation in the Program, prior to your commencement date, a full refund of the Program Fee (for the avoidance of doubt this includes the Deposit) will be given to you. A full refund will be issued only if the cancellation is for reasons which are in no way whatsoever attributable to you. No compensation can be given for any other costs incurred in relation to the Program. <br>(h) In the event that you are refused an appropriate visa or suitable alternative by the Local Authorities, a full refund of the Program Fee and the Deposit will be paid if; (1) you filled out all and any visa forms correctly, and (2) completed all steps in the required visa process correctly and on time. No compensation can be given for cancellation of flights or any other costs whatsoever incurred by you. No refund of Deposit and/or Program Fee will be offered if your tardiness in completing the necessary visa requirements leads to start dates being delayed and your internship being cancelled.<br> (i) All refunds are paid via bank transfer. <br>(j) We do not withhold any processing fee or service charge from refunds. However, the refund amount you receive may be less than you expected, due to fees or charges imposed by your bank or by other intermediary financial institutions. We have no control over this and cannot cover or reimburse these fees. <br>(k) Any refund must be initiated within 6 months after the internship program start date selected by the participant. After this date, refunds are made solely at our discretion. <br>(l) All refunds and reimbursements will be processed within 21 days. <br><br>5.

YOUR RESPONSIBILITY<br> (a) It is your responsibility to be aware of any national holidays or other events that may change the nature of the Program. While most companies operate a 9-5 working policy, some may have different requirements and we cannot be held responsible for this. <br>(b) International flights are not included in the cost of any of our Programs. It is your sole responsibility to arrange flights and insurance and to select providers based on your own decisions and experiences.

Program, you will receive a discount or rebate of 300 USD on your program fee, subject to the further terms given below. <br>(b) If your Program is priced in a currency other than USD, we may convert this amount to your Program’s currency at the then-current exchange rate. (The program currencies are listed in section 3(a) above.) <br>(c) You may refer your friend to any Program offered by Enveiria, Inc. at any destination or date. Your friend’s Program does not need to be in the same city, or at the same time, as your own.<br> (d) Your friend must mention your name as their referral during the admissions process. This can include their interview or their follow up with their Admissions Officer. If your friend mentions the referral after the admissions process has been completed, and they are already confirmed as a participant, the Program Director will decide if you’re still eligible for the discount or rebate. <br>(e) Your discount or rebate will be granted only when your friend confirms a place in their Program by paying at least 50% of their program fee. <br>(f) The discount applies only to your total program fee. The discount does not reduce the amount required for the initial Deposit (600 British Pounds) or of any required minimum payments.<br> (g) You can refer a friend anytime, even after you have finished your Program. If you have already paid your entire program fee when you become eligible for this discount, then we will pay the amount to you as a rebate, via bank transfer (subject to the terms in part 4, sections (i) and (j) above.) <br>(h) There is no limit to the number of discounts or rebates you may earn. For every referral which satisfies the above terms, you will receive 300 USD or equivalent. <br><br>22.
